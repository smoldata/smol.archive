			<h2>Share with friends</h2>
			<p>Find your friends, make a space that you feel comfortable in. Selectively share on your own terms. Create channels for different social contexts. Connect with neighbors who live nearby you. Discover what other people are into. Don’t worry about algorithmic timelines, we don’t do that here.</p>

			<h2>Ditch the cloud</h2>
			<p>Your stuff gets stored on our member-run archive servers (or run your own), so you know exactly where your data is and who is looking after it. Once you have an archived copy, you might feel less of a need to keep it all stored <del>in the cloud</del> in a corporate datacenter.</p>
